## How to run:
1. Clone repository and navigate to repository via the command line. 
2. Use the following commands to run the program:
```
cd src
javac arcade/*
java arcade.UI
```

## Iteration 1 Questions:
### What user stories were completed in this iteration?
* A main game selection interface where a user can enter a number command to select a game to play
* A Rock Paper Scissors game where a user can play against a computer player. The user enters either 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors to play against a randomized computer player turn.
* A Hangman game where a user can play Hangman with either an easy or hard word. The user can make a wrong guess a maximum of 6 times to guess the word, otherwise the Hangman will be completed and the game is lost. 
### What user stories do you intend to complete in the next iteration?
* We intend on adding one additional game to our arcade. 
* We need to implement a way to exit the game when playing, and a way to repeat a game without exiting our program and rerunning it. 
### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* The JUnit tests for the UI class are mostly written but are not working yet. 
* The JUnit test for the check function in the RPS class is not completed. 


## Iteration 2 Questions:
### What user stories were completed in this iteration?
* After some of the feedback that we received, we decided to reorganized the entire branching structure of our project as the main focus of this iteration. We organized each branch into separate pieces of the project rather than divide the project up based on our names. This allows an external user to be able to see all of the moving parts of the project, and the progress that was made through commits in each of these branches individually. 
* All of the tests that are included on the games as well as the UI class have been written to ensure inclusivisity.
* A user is able to replay games and exit out of games; there were updates that were made in the UIClass of the code. 
### What user stories do you intend to complete in the next iteration?
* In the next iteration we intend to complete the game Tic Tac Toe; we currently have made some progress on that game but have not included it in this iteration for the sake of clarity. 
* Additionally we intend to heavily test the game to make sure the user does not encounter any bugs when trying to play any of our arcade games.
* Lastly we plan on including some imagery to add another element of user engagement with the arcade
### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* Currently we he have everything that we included in this iteration working.
