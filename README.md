2. Use the following commands to run the program:

javac arcade/*
java arcade.UI
```

## Iteration 1 Questions:
### What user stories were completed in this iteration?
* A main game selection interface where a user can enter a number command to select a game to play
* A Rock Paper Scissors game where a user can play against a computer player. The user enters either 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors to play against a randomized computer player turn.
* A Hangman game where a user can play Hangman with either an easy or hard word. The user can make a wrong guess a maximum of 6 times to guess the word, otherwise the Hangman will be completed and the game is lost. 
### What user stories do you intend to complete in the next iteration?
* We intend on adding one additional game to our arcade. 
* We need to implement a way to exit the game when playing, and a way to repeat a game without exiting our program and rerunning it. 
### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* The JUnit tests for the UI class are mostly written but are not working yet. 
* The JUnit test for the check function in the RPS class is not completed.
